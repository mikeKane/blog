# Rules for writing on the community blog.

Writing for *iOS Developers* is a simple process. By following this guide, you'll be well on your way to publishing to audience of over 5,000 people.

## When writing
- Use markdown. We suggest the popular open source Markdown editor for OS X, _[MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com)_.
- Each author will have their own directory. You **must** use this directory for all of your posts.
- Fork this repo. Write your article in your directory, naming the file the same as the title of your article, all lowercase replacing spaces with `-`.
- Once your post is ready for review, set up a pull request to the `master` branch on iosdevelopershq/blog. One of the authors will review your PR and once they're happy with it, they'll merge it to `master`.
- Once your article has been approved copy it over to [Blog](https://ios-developers.ghost.io/ghost/).

## When reviewing
- Read over the pull request and make any comments or corrections using GitHubs code review tools.
- Once you (and the author) are happy with the article and it is ready to be published, click the big green button and merge the pull request!

## When publishing
- Always update **Post Settings**. This can be accessed by clicking on the cog icon to the left of the **Save Draft/Publish** button.

- Always include personalised meta data. Again, in **Post Settings**, click on the **Meta Data** button.

- Each post must have either a royalty free image for its header or your own images, which you will allow *iOS Developers* to use solely for the purposes of this blog.

- Always tag your posts with relevant tags. We're not interested in masses of tags but a handful of relevant tags will suffice.
